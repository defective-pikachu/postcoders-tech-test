# put your "I would have done this with more time"-style comments here

I did complete this in two hours, though given more time, I would have:

- made better MUI cards. these were totally new to me and given the two-hour restriction, I didn't want to spend too long reading documentation

- improved CSS across the app including
-- better backgrounds and styling on the MUI cards
-- altered the App.css styling to make it more coherent with the MUI cards

- improved error handling for user area code input, such as
-- automatically converting incorrect area codes (e.g. M13 0PQ) to recognised inputs (M13)
-- recognising a completely wrong area code versus one that is more than just an outcode

- add pending statuses such as
-- isLoading, a very quick addition, but I am coming up to two hours!
-- isError
